

Java has an API for working with databases, and this technology is known as JDBC. JDBC
provides the developer with tools that allow clients to connect to databases and send commands
to the database


1) you need to load the Database driver before Java programs can connect to that database 
    NOTE : You need to have a database specific jar before you connect 
    
2) WE are working with MYSQL Database so have mysql connector jar in your class path

3) PreparedStatement objects are used to send SQL commands to the database. As you may recall
 Statement objects are also used to send SQL commands to the database
